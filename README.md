# Trybetunes

HungryApp is a recipes app build with ReactJS for mobile. Users should be able to search for recipes from all around the world using diferent types of filters, save their favorite recipes, register their progress in making that recipe, and there's also a possibility to create and edit a personal profile. For data, we used [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and [The CockTailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

This was the final project for the Frontend Module of the FullStack Web Development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), and it was a group project. [Nathalia Miranda](https://github.com/nathaliamiranda), [Millene Galetti](https://github.com/MilleneGalettiAcosta), [Gabriel Pinheiro](https://github.com/GabrielFMPinheiro) and [Andr√© Mello](https://github.com/Andre-S-Melo) were part of this amazing team. :rocket:

## Challenges

All I can say about this project is that it was an amazing practice for the "real life" team work. The main challenge - and the greatest learning, after all - was to learning how to work well in a team where each person had their own strengths and weaknesses. But we got lucky, because we all were really focused on doing our best job, not only with the code, but also in help and lift each other up. I'm safe to say that this was my best teamwork experience so far, and I think that the final project reflects this. We were all really proud of the final product, even though it's not finished yet in terms of styling.

Talking about that, I do plan to get back to this project and not only refactor some of the code, but also finish the CSS that we didn't have the time to finish due our deadline.

## Credits
Although most of the bussiness rules of the app we developed in team through pair programming, all the tests were developed exclusively by [Millene](https://github.com/MilleneGalettiAcosta) and [Gabriel](https://github.com/GabrielFMPinheiro).
